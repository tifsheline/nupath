###About:

In the modern age of social media, students have various platforms for communicating with friends and family alike.  What’s missing is a place for students to connect to other students without the noise of status updates and tweets.  **nUPath** provides a noise free, safe zone for students to discuss academia and their achievements.   

**nUPath** is designed with the purpose of helping students get a jumpstart on their career path after graduation.  High school Juniors and Seniors can use nUPath as their first online resume/portfolio.  College students can use nUPath to enhance their resume building skills and gain access to other universities and employers.  Through nUPath, students can connect worldwide to teachers, professors, faculty members, and fellow students.
